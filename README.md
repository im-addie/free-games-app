### 📋 Overview
The Free Games App represents an exciting milestone in my coding journey as it marks my very first front-end web application. Developed during my time at a coding bootcamp, this application showcases my newfound skills in front-end development, particularly in HTML, CSS, JavaScript. and React.

Using the [FreeToGame API](https://www.freetogame.com/api-doc), the primary objective of this project is to provide users with a seamless and user-friendly experience in discovering and playing free-to-play games across various categories. Allowing them to find the game that align with their preferences.

### ✨ Features
- Landing page
  - Showcases the most relevant free-to-play games to date
- Navbar
  - Allows users to filter by category or platform to easily find the game they are looking for
  - "New Releases" where it shows the user the 20 most recent video games from the FreeToGame API
- Details page
  - Individual pages of each game that shows their platform, category, description, and much more!
  - Contains a "PLAY GAME" button where it routes users to the game's official website where they may download the game

### 🛠️ Installation
- Open an integrated terminal for the "free-games-app" folder and run `npm install` to install dependencies.

### 🚀 Starting the app
- Using the intergrated terminal, run `npm start` to start the app!
